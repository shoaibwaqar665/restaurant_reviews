The food was great, service slightly slow, noticed our food on the benches sitting there for around 5 mins, and other pizzas came out after ours and they were delivered before ours.

They do have a few arcade games for the kids in the back and kids under 2 eat free.\nThe manager is sweet and checked on tables a few times her self, a few of the employees stood out as great as well. \n\nThe only thing I can recommend is allow the 2 year old a small glass with a lid for fee as well since they don\u2019t drink much.

La cosa positiva \u00e8 che il locale si trova a meno di dieci minuti con la macchina dall'Hollywood Boulevard (walk of fame). Se volete spendere poco, mangiare una pizza discreta e poi fare una passeggiata sulla via lastricata dalle stelle ve lo consiglio",
