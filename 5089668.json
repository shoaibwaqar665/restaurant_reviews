It's a short walk from Disneyland and conveniently located near lots of hotels.\n\nShakey's is the first franchise pizza chain in the United States and has some cool history behind it. The pizza was good. They've got your standard variety but also several more unique pizzas. My son amd I each got our own small pizzas and both turned out good. \n\nThey were busy (lots of Disney folks coming in) but we got our food pretty quickly. I would eat here again when visiting Disneyland.",

The wait was off set by the shifts manager stepping up to make our visit better. Her excellent service, helpfulness & attitude made the 40 min wait for our pizza worth it.  She even offered a free side dish. That is what can make or break the chance of returning customers. Well Done.",

So I've been coming here every time we go on vacation to Disneyland, it's one of our favorite spots, service is top notch, food  taste the same as when I was a kid and the pizza, fried chicken and mojos (potato wedges) are super good. Today I was reminded that I should write a review about my experience with them, so that's exactly what I'm doing. Thanks \"Sandra\" for reminding me, hope this helps spread the word about Shakeys!

Now, it's gone and when I find a Shakey's somewhere where I am travelling I try to stop by for a revisit to my youth.\n\nI have been to this location before, as it is convenient to the hotels I stay at while in Anaheim. It is an easy to get to location, just off I-5 and Ball, with good parking and lots of room inside! Tonight the parking lot was getting full but there were plenty of tables inside in  spite of families, groups and couples enjoying a pizza night this Saturday. \n\nThe place is moving with business, and ordering took about a 5 minute wait - not too b ad considering. I was surprise to see the salad bar back! I haven't seen one of those anywhere since COVID hit! A nice surprise, which I took advantage of along with ordering a small vegetarian pizza. \n\nThe plate for the salad is about the size of a side salad, and for $7.99 I figure I needed two go-arounds to get my money's worth! It is all you can eat, so don't feel guilty going back. The lettuce was fresh and plentiful, with a choice of toppings that were basic - croutons, beets and olives, peaches, red onions, pepperoncini, and similar. But the sliced mushrooms were out, there were no tomatoes or cucumbers, so not everything I like was there. The dressings were filled, and I lava flowed the blue cheese over my salad. \n\nThey bring your order to the table, and when I was getting my second plate the pizza arrived. It took 26 minutes from ordering, but I was still on my salad so was not a distraction to me. I think that is a reasonable time for a busy night.\n\nThe drinks are self-serve, but both machines were out of ice! Oyyy. Not sure why, they seemed large  enough but I guess ice was the rage that night.\n\nI liked the pizza (original thin of course!) and the salad was nice - I hadn't had a salad in a while.  The young man taking the order was very nice, and the young lady who ran my pizza to my table came back after I had returned from the salad bar and was good enough to ask if I needed a plate - she could have just left the pizza and been done with me. \n\nIt was good to see them cleaning tables pretty quickly, and even giving the drink station a good cleaning and replenishment of straws and stuff.\n\nThe game arcade was really popular with kids and teens, too - it was the place of fun and luck. \n\nOverall a very good meal, and a reminder of why Shakey's is one of my favorites!",

She few up in Sacramento where Shakey\u2019s originated. Neither of us knew there were any still around. \n\nCalled in advance to confirm that they had gluten-free pizza crust. They said yes and suspiciously in all sizes. However, when we called back to order a pizza they said they do not offer a gluten-free crust at all. \n\nSo we got our gluten-free medium pizza from nearby Carolina\u2019s instead. They say you can never go Home. Guess not. Too bad. ",
